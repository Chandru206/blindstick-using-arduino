# Smart Blind Stick using Arduino UNO

An assistive device for visually impaired users built with Arduino UNO, HCâ€‘SR04 ultrasonic sensor, buzzer, and LED for real-time obstacle detection.

## ðŸ”— Live Simulation
[Run it here on Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/projects/35d9b1e0e3fca4ed)

## ðŸŒŸ Features
- Real-time distance measurement up to 50â€¯cm  
- Adaptive buzzer + LED alerts based on proximity  
- Fast beep for <10â€¯cm, medium for 11â€‘30â€¯cm, slow for 31â€‘50â€¯cm

## â›“ Usage
1. Clone the repo and open `sketch.ino` in Arduino IDE  
2. Install components:
   - Arduino UNO, HCâ€‘SR04, Buzzer, LED + 220â€¯Î© resistor
